## Domain Description
We will implement a simplistic view of a Database. 
You will discuss this further on DB Systems (CSCI3287).

You will have two tables `Students` and `Courses` that are accessed by
the id of each object. 
Moreover, there's a third collection of records, corresponding to the transcripts
You will generate the transcripts by connecting the data from these records with the students
and courses. 

You will finalize the implementation of the dictionary. 

Check the [pdf](./w07.Lab.Dicts.pdf), for the slides discussed in the presentation of this lab.
